# Hono + Datastar on Cloudflare Workers
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - task (https://taskfile.dev) — the ONLY prerequisite
#   - Bun is auto-installed by `task deps` if not present
#
# Quick start:
#   task deps        # install Bun (if needed) + all dependencies
#   task dev         # start dev server with live logs
#   task test        # run e2e tests against local server
#   task deploy      # deploy to Cloudflare Workers
#
# All tasks are idempotent — safe to run multiple times.
#
# Architecture notes:
#   - Workers CANNOT share I/O objects between requests (no persistent SSE broadcast)
#   - Module-level state works locally (single process) but is per-isolate in production
#   - For production shared state, use Workers KV or Durable Objects
#   - Static files served via [assets] in wrangler.toml (NOT [site])

# Ensure ~/.bun/bin is on PATH so freshly-installed Bun is found immediately

    summary: |
      NOTE: Counter state is per-isolate in production. Multi-tab and
      sequential tests may see inconsistent counts across isolates.
      Use Workers KV or Durable Objects for production-grade state.

      Usage:
        task test:deployed                              # uses DEPLOYED_URL from Taskfile
        task test:deployed -- https://your.workers.dev  # override with explicit URL
        DEPLOYED_URL=https://... task test:deployed      # override via env var
    cmds:
      - echo "Testing against {{if .CLI_ARGS}}{{.CLI_ARGS}}{{else}}{{.DEPLOYED_URL}}{{end}}"
      - BASE_URL={{if .CLI_ARGS}}{{.CLI_ARGS}}{{else}}{{.DEPLOYED_URL}}{{end}} bun run test
